Tetahi taniwha  
Kauhoe i te moana  
Kohimu i taku taringa  
"Kia haere taua  
Tipi haere tirotiro  
I raro i te moana.  

Ka mea au "Kao, kao, kao!  
Me haere, haere koe  
Ahakoa he hoa taua.  
Tatari ana taku Mama  
Kei raro i te rakau kowhai  
Taniwha, haere ra 

One day a taniwha  
Went swimming in the moana  
He whispered in my taringa  
Won't you come along with me   
There such a lot to see  
Underneath the deep blue sea.

I said "Oh, no, no, no!  
You'd better go, go, go,  
Although I know we could be friends.  
My Mama's waiting for me  
Underneath the kowhai tree  
Taniwha, haere ra!"
